          <div class="gpx-description">
            A 200-mile joyride that hits up the very best of Central Texas cycling. Stops available at New Braunfels, the Feed Store in Blanco, Fredericksburg, Boerne, and anywhere inside 1604. The sections on Nacogdoches out to NB, 306 by Canyon lake, and the return on Blanco are a little traffic-heavy, so this route is best done on the weekend and started early before traffic gets too bad. <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/3284603211126206630">Strava Link</a>

          <div class="gpx-description">
            A lovely century between San Antonio and Austin. Take the Amtrak on the way back (usually runs from Austin at about 6pm) for an excellent multi-modal transit day. Starting at Mila on Broadway, head north to Canyon Lake and then push onto Austin. If you'd like, you can also go up to New Braunfels before heading west to Canyon Lake. Stops available along the way. The sections on S 1st and S Congress in Austin are definitely more trafficy than is ideal, so stay aware. <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/3309302802690749552">Strava Link</a>

            Starting at a gas station on State Hwy 46, enjoy some lumpy roads just north of San Antonio. Bonus climb to Canyon Lake, if you're feeling brave. Stop available in Sattler, about halfway through the ride. <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/3247191570460250184">Strava Link</a>

            Courtesy of Spectra Racing, start at Bullis County Park and head out on some hilly roads to Boerne. Enjoy a pastry at Bear Moon Bakery & Cafe, slightly off the route, before heading to Bulverede and back to Bullis. There is a stop available at Luke's County Mart in Bulverde, but it's slightly off the route as well. <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/3231033823459206410">Strava Link</a>
